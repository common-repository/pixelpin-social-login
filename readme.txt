A highly secure, user-friendly visual authentication solution that strengthens user engagement and brand loyalty, replacing traditional passwords.

== Description ==
<strong>PixelPin</strong> provides a highly secure, user-friendly and personalised visual authentication solution that strengthens user engagement and brand loyalty, whilst ensuring a higher level of security than traditional alphanumeric passwords. It's a cloud-based solution that's cost effective, easy to deploy, and works across all devices. PixelPin's innovative solution uses a photo instead of a PIN or password to login. Users select 4 points on a pre-selected image. It works on any device.

PixelPin is currently free to WordPress users during this introductory offer.

Using <strong>PixelPin Social Login</strong>, your blog users will be able to login using PixelPin alongside other social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, Google and Yahoo.

<strong>PixelPin Social Login</strong> gives you absolute control over users access to your website and comes with a painfully long list of rules and restrictions for you to setup.

<strong>Free, unlimited and white-label</strong> Licenced under the MIT License, WordPress Social Login (on which PixelPin social login is based) is available to everyone for completely free, with all features included, at absolutely no cost. You are free to use a PixelPin Social Login in commercial websites as long as the copyright header is left intact.

Note: As the "PixelPin Social Login" plugin is nearly identical to "WordPress Social Login" (the only difference being the addition of the PixelPin provider) it is advised that you do not have both plugins installed, taking up unnecessary space, and potentially causing avoidable problems and confusion.  

<strong>Built on top of an Open Source Library</strong> The HybridAuth Library enables developers to easily build social applications to engage website vistors and customers on a social level by implementing social signin, social sharing, users profiles, friends lists, activities stream, status updates and more.

<strong>23 supported social networks</strong> Depending on the audience you're targeting, you can choose from a wide variety of providers and services including: Social networks, Microblogging platforms, Professional networks, Media, Photo sharing, Programmers and Gamers networks.
